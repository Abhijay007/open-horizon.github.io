# {{site.data.keyword.agbot}} API
{: #agbot_api}

In {{site.data.keyword.edge_notm}} ({{site.data.keyword.ieam}}), the {{site.data.keyword.horizon}} {{site.data.keyword.agbot}} software runs automatically. Each {{site.data.keyword.agbot}} is responsible for communicating with all of the agents that are registered to run services by negotiating agreements with the agents. The `hzn agbot` commands interact with these REST APIs. These APIs are not remotely accessible; they can only be used by processes running on the same host as the {{site.data.keyword.agbot}}.

For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.horizon}} Agreement Bot APIs](../anax/docs/agreement_bot_api.md).

{{site.data.keyword.horizon_exchange}} also exposes {{site.data.keyword.agbot}} configuration REST APIs, which are accessed by the `hzn exchange agbot` command.
